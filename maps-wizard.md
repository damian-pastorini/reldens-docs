## Maps Wizard

In the admin panel you will find the Maps Wizard, which will help you to generate and import your maps at once.

Go to the administration panel > Wizards > Maps Generation and Import

### 1 - Generate the map(s)

The wizard has 4 main options to create maps from different types of files.

Note: for glossary purpose I will use "TME" when referring to the "Tiled Map Editor" app. 

Here you can find a brief description of each option and links to their full documentation:

1. ["Generate a SINGLE random map with Layer Elements Object Loader (LayerElementsObjectLoader)"](generators/maps-single-layer-elements-object-loader.md):
   - For this option you will need to create a single JSON file with "TME" for each element on your scene map.
   - Then on your "Generator data", you will need to provide how many of each element the generator has to create. 
2. ["Generate a SINGLE random map with Layer Elements Composite Loader (LayerElementsCompositeLoader)"](generators/maps-single-layer-elements-composite-loader.md):
3. ["Generate MULTIPLE random maps by Multiple Loader (MultipleByLoaderGenerator)"](generators/maps-multiple-multiple-by-loader-generator.md):
4. ["Generate MULTIPLE random maps with Layer Elements Composite Loader (MultipleWithAssociationsByLoaderGenerator)"](generators/maps-multiple-multiple-with-associations-by-loader-generator.md): 

To show the simple way to create tons of maps we will choose the last one.
