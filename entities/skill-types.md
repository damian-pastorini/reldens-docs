### Skill Types

The skill will have a different behavior according to their type.

The available types are:
- Base
- Attack
- Effect
- Physical Attack
- Physical Effect

IMPORTANT: These can be changed (CRUD) from the admin panel, but you will need to also include the code to implement the behavior for any new type you may create.
