### Level

A "level" in Reldens is the entity to which we associate the player growth.

The "level" properties are:
- "key": a string value that will be used as unique and primary identifier for that level.
Normally it will be just numbers, but I've made as string to keep the platform open to modify the levels order more freely.
- "label": a string with any value that will bel displayed to users, like "Level 1" or "lvl 1".
- "required experience": the amount of experience to reach and activate this level.
- "Level Set ID": the level set ID (group) to which this level belongs.
