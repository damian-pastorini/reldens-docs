### Why was Reldens created?

Reldens was born out of a passion for game development and a love for classic 2D RPGs, inspired by my early experience with the old RPG Maker 2000.

While single-player games offered creative freedom, the rich and dynamic nature of multiplayer gaming became the driving force behind this project.

Recognizing the steep learning curve and challenges of developing multiplayer games, such as ensuring security, minimizing lag, and maintaining cross-platform compatibility, Reldens was created as a solution.

The platform leverages standard technologies to provide a developer-friendly, scalable tool that evolves with advancements in the industry.
